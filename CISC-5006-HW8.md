## Homework 8 -  Due 04/04/2023 8 PM EST


### Description
---
In class, we looked at filling a 2D grid with a specific color and used a queue to do it. We can also use a stack as well. In this homework assignment, we'll look at what the potential differences are.


### Assignment

Below is the code we used in class to fill the grid.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <cstddef>
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

enum class Color
{
    BLACK,
    WHITE,
    RED,
    GREEN,
    BLUE,
    YELLOW,
};

struct Position {
    int r, c;
};

class Grid
{
public:
    // initialize a black [size x size] grid
    explicit Grid(size_t size)
        : g_(size, std::vector<Color>(size, Color::BLACK))
    {}

    Color& operator()(size_t r, size_t c)
    {
        return g_[r][c];
    }

    const Color& operator()(size_t r, size_t c) const
    {
        return g_[r][c];
    }

    void draw(std::ostream& os) const
    {
        for (size_t row = 0; row < g_.size(); ++row) {
            os << "\t";
            for (size_t col = 0; col < g_[row].size(); ++col) {
                draw(os, g_[row][col]);
            }
            os << "\n";
        }
    }

    void fill(int r, int c, Color new_color)
    {
        std::queue<Position> q;

        q.push(Position {r, c});

        Color color = g_[r][c];

        // keep track of visited positions to avoid
        std::vector<Position> visited;
        while (!q.empty()) {
            // extract the position to visit
            Position position_to_consider = q.front();
            q.pop();

            int row = position_to_consider.r;
            int col = position_to_consider.c;

            std::vector<Position> neighbors = find_neighbors_of(row, col, color);

            // visit the cell and mark it as visited
            g_[row][col] = new_color;
            visited.push_back(position_to_consider);

            // add any neighbors to visit that haven't already been visited
            for (const Position& p : neighbors) {
                if (!is_visited(visited, p)) {
                    q.push(p);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    int size() const
    {
        return (int) g_.size();
    }

        case Color::YELLOW: os << "ðŸŸ¨"; break;
        }
    }

    // Remember, their are eight potential neighbors to consider

                // do not consider myself a neighbor
                if (dr == 0 && dc == 0)
                    continue;

```

In order to see how the change in container will affect behavior, we need a way of observing the behavior each time through the loop. We can utilize our `draw` function to visualize the state of the grid. Add the following two lines right after we change the color of the cell: 

```cpp
std::cin.get();
draw(std::cout);
```

This code will wait for you to press `Enter` then draw the grid out to `std::cout`.

After applying the code change above, rebuild and rerun the code. You should be able to press `Enter` and see the state of the grid each time through the loop.

Run the code using a `std::queue` and observe how the cells are filled.

Change the code to use a `std::stack` and observe how the cells are filled.

1. __(2 points)__ What differences do you see using a queue vs stack?
2. __(3 points)__ Does using one over the other matter for this particular problem? Why or why not?
