# CISC-5006 Data Structures

## Homework 10 -  Due 04/18/2023 8 PM EST


### Description
---
In this homework assignment, we will test our depth of knowledge of the topics covered in our previous lecture. In class, we discussed the map data structure. We talked about how a map can be implemented using many different data structures; one particular map of interest is implemented as a pair of arrays. This is called a `flat map` because the data is laid out contiguously (flatly) in memory. It's also excellent for performance due to the linear data layout.


### Assignment
---
Your assignment is to implement `flat map` and answer the question below. You can use the below code snippet as a starting point and fill in the `TODO`s; each `TODO` is __1 point__.

1. (__1 point__) What is the big(O) of each of the operations __as you implemented them__ below? Why?


```cpp
#include <vector>

template <class Key, class Value>
class FlatMap
{
private:
  std::vector<Key> keys;
  std::vector<Value> values;
  
public:
    // insert the @key, @value pair if the @key does not exist
  	void insert(const Key& key, const Value& value) 
    {
      // TODO  
    }

    // determine if the @key is present in the map
    bool contains(const Key& key)
    { 
      // TODO 
    }

    // remove @key, if it exists, and its corresponding value from the map
    void remove(const Key& key)
    { 
      // TODO 
    }

    // update @key's value with @value
    // if the @key does not exist, treat the operation like an insert
    void update(const Key& key, const Value& value)
    { 
      // TODO 
    }
};
```

When you're finished, include all of your code in a `cpp` file and submit the cpp file to me over Slack or email prior to the deadline.
